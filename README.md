A landing page website template that has ability to do elements transition effect along with window vertical scroll.

**How to Use?**

Add or remove elements that use transition effect in 'script.js' not in html or css file.
'scroll-transition' only works when element created in 'script.js'.
But if you want to add 'noscript' (when javascript off) elements, you can set them in html file.
